# Msg Wrektceivd

- Sender must type each letter
-- Speed and accuracy of letter tranmission is therefore dependent on:
--- Typing speed
--- Number of typos
-- Sender must strategically "burst type" letter sequences 

- Receiver must remember each letter received
-- Accuracy of message received is therefore dependent on:
--- Memory of receiver
--- "Speed Reading" capability of receiver
--- Ordering of letters received
--- Which letters were received (were they they the teammates or the opponents letters?)

- Receiver only sees "colored dots" and not the actual letters
-- The letters "blink/appear" on their screen temporarily when they are received


# Milestone #1
Shoot a letter across the screen.
