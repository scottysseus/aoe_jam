# Rational Discourse

_Rational Discourse_ is a game we created for the [Area of Effect](https://aoe-event.com/about) game jam. The jam was a 48 hour contest starting on 11/20/2020 as part of the larger event, which included key notes, raffles, and fundraisers. The theme this year was **Message Received** so we decided to make a game about political messaging and propaganda, and had much fun adding a humorous tone to that topic!
